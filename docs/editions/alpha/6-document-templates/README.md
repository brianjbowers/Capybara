The **Document Templates** section provides reusable templates that can support planning, communication, and advocacy for Capybara projects. These materials are intended to help teams present proposals, structure project documentation, and standardize reporting.

Templates may be customized to fit organizational standards and are particularly useful when pitching a Capybara initiative or formalizing project deliverables.
