*`The Under-Construction Pre-Beta Development Edition`*

The **Alpha Edition** of the **Capybara Framework** is an internal-only release intended exclusively for use by the CCISDA/CSAC Technology Executive Leadership Program
2025–26 Cohort, Team 2 development team. This alpha phase provides an early, hands-on environment to validate core concepts, architecture, and workflows while identifying
gaps, risks, and improvement opportunities in a controlled setting.

The upcoming Beta version will build on these learnings with greater stability, clearer documentation, refined features, and broader usability, reflecting feedback and
lessons gathered during the alpha cycle as the framework matures toward wider organizational adoption.
