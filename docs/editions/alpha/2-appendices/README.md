The **Appendices** collect supporting material that complements the main documentation without interrupting its flow. These sections provide definitions, background information, and supplementary explanations that help clarify concepts introduced elsewhere.

Use the appendices as a reference when you need deeper context, formal definitions, or additional detail that supports implementation and operational decisions.
