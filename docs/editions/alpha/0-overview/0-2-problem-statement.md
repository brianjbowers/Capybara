# Problem Statement

<img class="capybara-right" width="250px" src="../../../_images/L.png" alt="Capybara with a bright idea">County IT departments manage thousands of physical IT assets across numerous buildings, floors, offices, and shared spaces, yet asset and service management systems often lack precise, intuitive spatial context. This results in slower incident response, inconsistent asset records, inefficient field work, and limited visibility into location-based risks and dependencies.

A spatially enabled ITAM/ITSM solution—integrating ArcGIS Indoors with an existing IT service management platform—addresses these challenges by embedding floorplan-level location intelligence directly into IT workflows. A spatially enabled ITAM/ITSM solution reduces operational blind spots, strengthens accountability, and supports more resilient County IT operations.
