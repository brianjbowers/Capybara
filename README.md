# The Capybara Framework
The Capybara Framework is a guide for integrating an ITAM/ITSM solution (e.g. ServiceNow) with ArcGIS Indoors to ensure that location intelligence and operational workflows stay in sync.
## Problem Statement
County IT departments manage thousands of physical IT assets across numerous buildings, floors, offices, and shared spaces, yet asset and service management systems often lack precise, intuitive spatial context. This results in slower incident response, inconsistent asset records, inefficient field work, and limited visibility into location-based risks and dependencies.
A spatially enabled ITAM/ITSM solution—integrating ArcGIS Indoors with an existing IT service management platform—addresses these challenges by embedding floorplan-level location intelligence directly into IT workflows. A spatially enabled ITAM/ITSM solution reduces operational blind spots, strengthens accountability, and supports more resilient County IT operations.
## Framework Overview
Capybara is a clear, comprehensive implementation framework that guides counties through deploying the Capybara asset-tracking system. The framework packages essential requirements, architecture guidance, workflows, templates, and best practices into a ready-to-use guide.
The solution allows IT staff to visualize assets, incidents, and service requests within interactive indoor maps and floorplans, improving operational efficiency, data accuracy, and decision-making. Capybara implementation guidance follows a phased, pilot-first approach, leveraging existing GIS, facilities, and ITSM data wherever possible. Implementations establish a scalable, location-aware foundation for modern IT service delivery that improves operations today while enabling future capabilities tomorrow.
## Executive Summary
Capybara is a county-focused framework for deploying a cutting-edge, location-aware management solution for physical IT assets built on ArcGIS Online (AGOL) or ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. Leveraging ArcGIS Indoors, ArcGIS Field Maps, ArcGIS Survey123, and capable of integrating with modern ITAM and ITSM platforms, like ServiceNow—the frame-work describes the implementation of a spatially enabled, fully interoperable foundation for enhanced operational efficiency vis-à-vis managed assets and provisioned technical support.
The framework adheres to ITIL 4 and ISO 19770 best practices and aligns with standard IT governance and service management methodologies. It includes system requirements, reference architecture, deployment steps, integration design patterns, set-up/configuration instructions, checklists and cheat sheets, Python scripts and sample data, and a reusable project plan template with estimated budgets and timelines. The goal is to deliver an adaptable, turnkey guide that any county can use to successfully deploy its own Capybara instance as part of broader ITSM and ITAM modernization efforts.
## Key Takeaways
- **Spatially Empowered IT Operations:** Visualizing IT assets within buildings and floors improves efficiency, response time, and accuracy.
